<h2> Arrival Time Calculation from Inter-arrival Time </h2>

Simulation is the imitation of a real-world system in order to obtain data that can be used to evaluate and improve the system’s performance.<br/>
The arrival rate is the number of arrivals per unit of time.<br/>
The inter arrival time is the time between each arrival into the system and the next.</br>
To find out the value of arrival time I use this function.: <br/>
       ***`arrival_time[i] = inter_arrival_time[i] + arrival time[i-1].`***<br/><br/><br/>
