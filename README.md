# Arrival time calculation from Inter arrival Time

Simulation is the imitation of a real-world system in order to obtain data that can be used to evaluate and improve the system’s performance.
The arrival rate is the number of arrivals per unit of time.
The inter arrival time is the time between each arrival into the system and the next.
The arrival rate is calculated from the following equation; arrival rate = 1/inter arrival time 
To find out the value of arrival time value I use this function.: <br/>
       ***`arrival_time[i] = inter_arrival_time[i] + arrival time[i-1].`***<br/><br/><br/>
